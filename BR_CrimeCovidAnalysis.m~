% Purpose: Analyze the crime dynamics of Baton Rouge in response to the
% changes in social dynamics with the COVID pandemic

%% Variable Definition
% Bring in the Baton Rouge Data
BR_Crime = readtable('Baton_Rouge_Crime_Analysis.csv');

% Pull out specific dates
% SOE represents the state of emergency time period
% SAH represents the two weeks after the stay at home order was implemented
alldays_leap = linspace(1,103,103)';
PreCovid_BR = alldays_leap(1:71,:); % March 13 is when most businesses were closed
SOE_BR = alldays_leap(72:80,:); % March 22 was when SAH was put in place
SAH_BR = alldays_leap(81:95,:); % March 22 to April 5

% Break down data into chunks based on these dates
PreCovid_BPD_Crime = BPD_VBC(1:63,:);
SOE_BPD_Crime = BPD_VBC(64:88,:);
PreSAH_BR_Crime = BR_Crime(1:80,:);
SAH_BR_Crime = BR_Crime(81:95,:);

%% T-tests
% T-tests for comparing time periods
% Comparison between the full dataset and Pre-SAH
[h_B2, p_B2, ci_B2, stats_B2] = ttest2(PreSAH_BR_Crime.Vice, SAH_BR_Crime.Vice);


%% Figures
% Some figures because why not
